## Introduction
Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. The art style is inspired by 30's cartoons.

This randomizer randomizes multiple aspects of the game depending on the options.

Also, this game is in early development, so beware of the icky sticky stuff!

Feel free to speak out in the Cuphead thread on the [Archipelago Discord](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1050929729844297789) if you have any question or concerns.

This document is WIP also, so this may seem barren. Have fun!
