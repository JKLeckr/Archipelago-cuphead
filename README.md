# CupheadArchipelago World

*Archipelago World Created by JKLeckr*

Client Mod: [CupheadArchipelago](https://github.com/JKLeckr/CupheadArchipelagoMod)

This is the Archipelago world for Cuphead.

This apworld is currently in the development phase. While this is playable to some degree (with a working client), it is not feature complete and probably has bugs, so using it might pose mental injuries from grotesque code if you use it. Beware!
