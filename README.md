This is the Archipelago APWorld for Cuphead.

This apworld is currently in alpha. While it is better than it ever was since early development, there are still some freaky issues hiding in there. If you are wanting code so clean that you can see your reflection, you will think you are a vampire! Use at your own risk!

## How to use
Download the copy of the APWorld from the [releases](https://github.com/JKLeckr/Archipelago-cuphead/releases) page.
Copy it to the `custom_worlds` folder in the Archipelago installation folder.
